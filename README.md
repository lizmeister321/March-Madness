# March-Madness
My Entry for the HMC March Madness Challenge aka BRACKET-O-RANDO-MATIC 1600! 
Basically just picks teams by random seed and moves them along the rounds. 

Update 2016 to contain ACTUAL CODE.
Still doesn't really build a bracket yet but it's close! Word.

For games where no winner was picked (due to bad programming), I just found the next free bucket in the list, based on physical order in bracket.
Elite 8, Final 4, and Winners picked using coin toss script: heads is upper team, tails is lower team. repeat as needed.
code pulled from comments of: http://stackoverflow.com/questions/14882530/python-coin-toss

Final game score determined through an average of historical final game scores (see final_score.xlsx).

This is not scientific but it worked*
